Real-Time Weather Data Processing Platform
Project Overview
This project demonstrates a scalable real-time data processing platform using Apache Kafka, PySpark, and AWS services (MSK, S3, Redshift). It processes weather data fetched from a third-party API in real-time and performs data transformations before storing it for further analytics.

Key Features:
Ingest weather data from a third-party API in real-time.
Process the data using PySpark for cleaning, transformation, and aggregation.
Store the transformed data in AWS S3 and optionally load it into AWS Redshift for analytics.
Leverage AWS MSK (Managed Streaming for Kafka) to handle real-time streaming.
Architecture
The architecture of the platform includes:

AWS MSK (Kafka): Acts as the data streaming platform to which weather data is published.
PySpark: Used to consume Kafka data, process it, and perform necessary transformations.
AWS S3: Serves as the storage solution for processed data.
AWS Redshift (Optional): Used as a data warehouse to perform advanced analytics.

Prerequisites
To run this project, you'll need:

AWS Account with MSK, S3, and Redshift setup.
Kafka-Python library for producing and consuming messages.
PySpark for processing the data.
Boto3 for AWS interactions.
Weather API Key from a third-party provider (e.g., OpenWeatherMap).

Project Setup

Project Structure

├── producer1.py  # Script to fetch weather data and produce to Kafka
├── pyspark_consumer.py # PySpark script to consume, transform and store data
├── store.py           # Required dependencies
├── README.md                  # Project documentation

How to Run
1. Kafka Setup on AWS MSK
Create an AWS MSK cluster and configure the Kafka broker.

Create a Kafka topic weather-data:

kafka-topics.sh --create --zookeeper <zookeeper-url> --replication-factor 3 --partitions 3 --topic weather-data

2. Run the Kafka Producer
The producer fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and sends it to the Kafka topic weather-data.

python producer1.py

3. Run the PySpark Consumer
The consumer processes the data, converts temperatures from Kelvin to Celsius, and writes the processed data to AWS S3.


spark-submit spark_consumer.py

4. Optional: Load Data into Redshift
If you want to load the processed data from S3 into Redshift, use the boto3 script provided in the project.
